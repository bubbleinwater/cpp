/*
Q. Can we declare a non-reference function argument const(e.g., void f(const int);)? What might that mean? Why might
 we want to do that? Why don't people do that often? Try it; write a couple of small programs to see what works.

yes we can.
once you declare, that value inside int won't change in the fuction just like as write const int x = 7;.(?)
