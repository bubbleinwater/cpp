how to use Date type in main() is like..

	Chrono::Date today;
	cout << today << '\n';

	today.add_day(1);
	Chrono::Date tomorrow = today;

	cout << tomorrow << '\n';

2019.apr.18
modified add_day.
but I could hardly understand what add_yaer means.A year has 365 day? so that add one year means equal add 365 day? or just increasing the y?

2019.apr.23
catch(Chrono::Date::Invalid){
	error("invalid date.");
	}
does not work.
{cerr<<"invalid date.}
works.

exercise 11.
first I'll implement enum class Day_of_the_week{}

2019,apr,27
I added operator== and != for Date
and ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, Day_of_the_week& day);
and == for day
and 	Day_of_the_week whats_the_day(Date d)
you must not write as Day_of_the_week whats_the_day(Date& d)
if you do, this function will change the value of d

bool operator==(const Day_of_the_week& a, const Day_of_the_week& b); did not needed.

if you want to use cout << style, you have to
write as
Date& next_workday(Date d);
not as
Date next_workday(Date d);

2019.may.1
at the main function,I wanted to write like this.

Chrono::Date today = {1999,Chrono::Month::apr,17};/*={1978, Month::jun, 25 };
cout << "today is " << today << '\n';
Chrono::Day_of_the_week dd = Chrono::whats_the_day(today);
cout << dd << '\n';
cout << "next work day is " << Chrono::next_workday(today);

but the last 2 line didn't work(they caused runtime error) so I changed them to this

Chrono::Date work_d = Chrono::next_workday(today);
cout << "next work day is " << work_d;

and also whats_the_day(Date &d) didn't work.

2019.may.2
added week_of_year
